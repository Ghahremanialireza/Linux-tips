How to change GRUB bootloader Default - UBUNTU 23.04
#####################################################
if you are using Dual boot like me you will need this ...


	sudo vim /etc/default/grub

Find the line that contains
GRUB_DEFAULT=0
and set it to
GRUB_DEFAULT=x

where x is the index of grub menu item to which you would like to boot to by default. Note that the menu items are zero-indexed. That means that the first item in the list is 0 and that the sixth item is actually 5. So to boot to the sixth item in the list, the line would read:
GRUB_DEFAULT=5
If you forgot the order of the items, take a look at /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Each menu entry is specified by a line of type:
menuentry 'Ubuntu' [options] {
You can also chose the default by the name instead of index, e.g.:
GRUB_DEFAULT='Ubuntu'

Then build the updated grub menu:

	sudo update-grub
